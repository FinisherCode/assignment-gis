- Application for dog owners - Helps to navigate to points of interst (vets, pet stores, dog parks)

- Scenarios:
	1. Find points of interest (vets, pet stores dog parks) within range (there was just one dog park on my map so in dog parks scenario I skipped
	picking range step)
	after picking place user can choose way of transport: 
		2. After choosing walk/bycicle application navigates to chosen point
		3. After choosing car application shows on map where are all park lots nerby chosen place (It was intended to look for
			park lots that are within 200 meters range, but there were points of interest that has no park lots withing that range
			so I changed it so it finds all park lots that their distance from target point is smaller than mine distance to 
			target point)
		4. After choosing bus application finds closest bus stop to me and closest bus stop to the target point. Then user can choose to navigate
		to bus stop, what takes him to navigation or he can check bus connections from start bus stop to end bus stop at
		'https://imhd.sk/ba/cestovne-poriadky' - button takes him to browser application so he can come back to application
		for checking names of bus stops.
		
Android application (frontend - thick client) was created in java (android API >= 19)

Backend was proggramed in java spring (application server), for communication I used RESTFull web services
	- In spring I used raw queries to access database, because hibernate was not able to map postgis objects
		GET /status returns ok when server is running (just to test wheater server is online)
	s1	GET /get_vets?x=48.1587084&y=17.0673788&distance=5000
	s1	GET /get_pet_stores?x=48.1587084&y=17.0673788&distance=2000
	s1	GET /get_dog_parks?x=48.1587084&y=17.0673788
	s3	GET /get_park_lots?x=48.1587084&y=17.0673788&my_x=47.98475&my_y=17.6518

	each result is JSONArray of JSONObjects

Database: PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension, I used data from  3rd class (3-gis) - it had everything I needed.
		
NOTES: - application has default design (nothing nice - no time for UX texting), but it should be responsive for many devices 
		(tested on 1920x1080 (nexus 5, API 23), 2560Ã—1440 (nexus 6 API 25) - it looked same)
	   - for navigation I used google Maps application 
	   - for browsing web pages I used browser application
	   - for google maps view I registred API key on https://console.developers.google.com and registred my application's credentials to this key.
